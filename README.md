CatShanks
=========

CatShanks or Cats, Sharks, and Snakes is a generic horrizontal sidescrolling space shooter for android. 

Coded in android studio, Catshanks uses a custom opengl2 based framework, that is well commented(At least the graphics/audio managers are.) and easy to use, and is thus the perfect stepping stone for anyone looking to learn basic game programming concepts and/or opengl.

To load this into android studio, simply create a new project in android studio.(Name it whatever you like.)
Copy everything from the source folder directly into the src folder in the project, and update the package references.
Additionally, the android manifest may have to be edited to provide the proper entry point into the application. (Which FYI is MainActivity.java)

After this has been done, download the latest gson library and place it in a folder libs under the app folder in android studio.
